# Rust Web Cookie (wcookie)

`wcookie` is an HTTP Cookie implementation written in Rust.

Cookie semantics is defined in [RFC6265](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6265):

* Cookies are sent from web servers to user agents in `Set-Cookie` HTTP Response headers as defined in [Set-Cookie header](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6265#section-4.2).
* User agents, can incluide Cookies in `Cookie` HTTP request headers when some criteria are met, as defined in [Cookie header](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6265#section-5.4).

`wcookie` can be use for managing cookies at both web client and server implementations.
